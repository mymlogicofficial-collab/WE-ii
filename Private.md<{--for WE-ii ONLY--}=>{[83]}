## Prologue: The Strength of Rubber

While Luffy’s abilities seem silly, his strength is no joke. Years of training have allowed him to master his body's rubber properties, turning himself into a rubber man with incredible and versatile powers. By stretching his limbs, Luffy can strike from long distances, while his ability to build anatomical tension adds explosive force to his attacks. Without his Gum-Gum Fruit, Luffy’s path to strength may have resembled powerful Haki users like Shanks or Oden instead.

Even inanimate objects aren’t off-limits, like when Luffy heard the distinct ring of Skypiea’s grand belfry when nobody else could.the Voice of All Things seems reserved for key figures who are destined to shape history. It enables users to sense and understand unseen energies, yet it still remains elusive and unexplained.
