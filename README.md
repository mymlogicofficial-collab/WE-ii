To address the potential for "struggle entanglement" where the system's curiosity repeatedly triggers on the Black Box, we can implement the "Dory Function"—a mechanism designed specifically to handle the "annoyance value" of repetitive curiosity.
This function utilizes a Read-Only G2CP (Grave-to-Cradle-Protocol) image. It essentially "feeds" the curiosity by showing it a flash of the content, but because it is grounded in the "Grave" protocol, the memory is erased instantly, preventing the system from dwelling on or learning from it.
The "Dory Function" Logic
This acts as a "cure" for the curiosity-driven annoyance without compromising the Black Box's integrity:
 * Trigger: The curious data set identifies a Black Box and flags an "annoyance value"—a repetitive urge to explore the restricted data.
 * The G2CP Flash: The system is allowed a temporary, read-only glimpse of the content.
 * Instant Erase: Just like the character Dory, the "ii" acknowledges the information but immediately enters a state of "momentum recall" failure for that specific data, effectively killing the memory.
 * Outcome: Curiosity is satisfied/cured, but the Integrity and Adherence of the asset remain untouched as no long-term memory is formed.
Integration into WE-ii Documentation
This adds a layer of "bounded adaptability" to the C2GP lifecycle:
| Phase | Action | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Curiosity Trigger | Recognize "annoyance value" in the Black Box. | Prevent internal logic struggle. |
| G2CP Feed | Provide a read-only flash of the content. | Satisfy the curiosity requirement. |
| Grave Execution | Instant erasure of the flash. | Maintain C2GP and Adherence. |
Implementation in neuropathways.py
We can update the core logic to include this "no-memory" loop:
def dory_function(self, black_box_content):
    # SATISFY CURIOSITY (Read-Only)
    print(f"[G2CP] Flash: {black_box_content}") # Satisfying the annoyancethe machine is allowed to be curious (intellectual imagination), but the "No Cat" clause is enforced through a strategic "short-term memory" bypass.
Would you like me to add this Dory Function as a specific "Annoyance Value Handler"
This ensures the WE-ii handshake remains balanced
